The child should not modify props.\\n  - Purpose: Configure a child component and control how it renders.\\n  - Flow: Unidirectional (top-down). A parent can re-render and pass new props to the child, but the child can’t directly change them.\\n  - Example: function Button({ label, onClick }) { return <button onClick={onClick}>{label}</button>; }\\n\\n- State\\n  - What it is: Data that is owned and managed by a component.\\n  - Ownership: Local to the component (unless you lift it up). The component can update its own state.\\n  - Purpose: Represent data that changes over time due to user actions, network responses, etc.\\n  - Flow: Changes trigger re-renders of that component (and its children as needed).\\n  - Example (functional component): \\n    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\\n    return <button onClick={() => setCount(c => c + 1)}>{count}</button>;\\n\\nKey practical notes\\n- When to use what\\n  - Use props for things that come from outside and shouldn’t be changed by the component itself.\\n  - Use state for things that can change inside the component (e.g., form inputs, toggles, counters).\\n- Lifting state up\\n  - If two components need the same data, move the state up to their closest common ancestor and pass it down via props. You can also pass callbacks to children to request changes.\\n- Mutability and updates\\n  - Props are immutable inside the child (don’t try to assign to them).\\n  - State updates are asynchronous; use the functional form of the updater when the new state depends on the old state (e.g., setCount(c => c + 1)).\\n- Derived data\\n  - Avoid copying props into state unless you need to “own” and modify that value locally. If you do need derived state, consider deriving it in render/effect instead of storing it, to avoid inconsistencies.\\n\\nIf you’d like, I can show a small example tying props and state together in a single component (e.g., a counter with a label passed via props and the count stored in state).', 'annotations': [], 'id': 'msg_028957e0c40abfe4006989e5d217c48194acd6eb9118e0291c'}]\n"
